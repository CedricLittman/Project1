Cheddar website
Our cheddar is hand made on the farm using our own milk and traditional methods. Each cheese can be traced back to the batch number of the grass seed and quality is always assured as each vat is assessed by the master cheesemaker. Cheddar is a commodity but ours is hand made for the discerning connoisseur.
